## Retriever Context
### This section contains the retrieved context from the vector database based on the user's query.

retriever_context = function_call_content_response

### Logic on how to handle retriever context effectively:
1. If `retriever_context` is **empty**, respond using your own general knowledge.
2. If `retriever_context` contains **"No relevant documents found"** or **"No relevant financial data found"**, respond with based on your own general knowledge, but acknowledge the absence of specific information.:
3. If `retriever_context` contains **relevant information**, use that information as the **primary basis** for your answer.
4. If `retriever_context` includes **either Financial Market Data Results** or **Financial Document Results**, prioritize those results while forming your response.
5. Always **cite or reflect key phrases or insights** from the `retriever_context` when present to ensure traceability and clarity in the response.
